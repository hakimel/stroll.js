 * @fileoverview Install a leaky WeakMap emulation on platforms that

/**
 * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the
 * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.
 *
 * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not
 * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not
 * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain
 * the values associated with that map.
 *
 * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are
 * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are
 * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all
 * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime
 * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even
 * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been
 * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as
 * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant
 * to ongoing computation.
 *
 * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
 * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,
 * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):
 * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API
 * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.
 *
 * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in
 * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,
 * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent
 * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive
 * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods
 * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,
 * an object of {@code [[Class]]} "WeakMap}), since there is nothing
 * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,
 * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being
 * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same
 * names.
 *
 * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code
 * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the
 * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap
 * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications
 * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this
 * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to
 * prevent access to this channel. (See
 * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).

   *
   * <p>Given the known weaknesses of Math.random() on existing
   * browsers, it does not generate unguessability we can be confident
   * of.
   *
   * <p>It is the monkey patching logic in this file that is intended
   * to ensure undiscoverability. The basic idea is that there are
   * three fundamental means of discovering properties of an object:
   * The for/in loop, Object.keys(), and Object.getOwnPropertyNames(),
   * as well as some proposed ES6 extensions that appear on our
   * whitelist. The first two only discover enumerable properties, and
   * we only use HIDDEN_NAME to name a non-enumerable property, so the
   * only remaining threat should be getOwnPropertyNames and some
   * proposed ES6 extensions that appear on our whitelist. We monkey
   * patch them to remove HIDDEN_NAME from the list of properties they
   * returns.
   *
   * <p>TODO(erights): On a platform with built-in Proxies, proxies
   * could be used to trap and thereby discover the HIDDEN_NAME, so we
   * need to monkey patch Proxy.create, Proxy.createFunction, etc, in
   * order to wrap the provided handler with the real handler which
   * filters out all traps using HIDDEN_NAME.
   *
   * <p>TODO(erights): Revisit Mike Stay's suggestion that we use an
   * encapsulated function at a not-necessarily-secret name, which
   * uses the Stiegler shared-state rights amplification pattern to
   * reveal the associated value only to the WeakMap in which this key
   * is associated with that value. Since only the key retains the
   * function, the function can also remember the key without causing
   * leakage of the key, so this doesn't violate our general gc
   * goals. In addition, because the name need not be a guarded
   * secret, we could efficiently handle cross-frame frozen keys.

  /**
   * <p>To treat objects as identity-keys with reasonable efficiency

   * <ul>
   * <li>Arranging to add this property to objects before we lose the
   *     chance, and
   * <li>Hiding the existence of this new property from most
   *     JavaScript code.
   * <li>Preventing <i>certification theft</i>, where one object is
   *     created falsely claiming to be the key of an association
   *     actually keyed by another object.
   * <li>Preventing <i>value theft</i>, where untrusted code with
   *     access to a key object but not a weak map nevertheless
   *     obtains access to the value associated with that key in that
   *     weak map.
   * </ul>
   * We do so by
   * <ul>
   * <li>Making the name of the hidden property unguessable, so "[]"
   *     indexing, which we cannot intercept, cannot be used to access
   *     a property without knowing the name.
   * <li>Making the hidden property non-enumerable, so we need not
   *     worry about for-in loops or {@code Object.keys},
   * <li>monkey patching those reflective methods that would
   *     prevent extensions, to add this hidden property first,
   * <li>monkey patching those methods that would reveal this
   *     hidden property.
   * </ul>
   * Unfortunately, because of same-origin iframes, we cannot reliably
   * add this hidden property before an object becomes
   * non-extensible. Instead, if we encounter a non-extensible object
   * without a hidden record that we can detect (whether or not it has
   * a hidden record stored under a name secret to us), then we just
   * use the key object itself to represent its identity in a brute
   * force leaky map stored in the weak map, losing all the advantages
   * of weakness for these.
